# Guessing_number

This game is a number guessing game that can be played by either one or two players. At the beginning of the game, players are prompted to choose the game mode: single-player or two-player. After selecting the game mode, players must set the range of numbers to be guessed by entering a minimum and a maximum value.

Once the range is set, players take turns guessing the number within the specified range. Each guess is followed by feedback indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. If the guess is correct, the game announces the winner and restarts, giving players the option to play again by selecting the number of players.
